The data from these files comes from two nodes buried in _snow_ (not
dirt) that ran until their batteries ran out. It turns out that's not
100% true - the batteries were depleted to about 3.10 volts and the
MCUs stopped. Without a load the battery voltages were about 3.68 v.

These nodes had newer software and did not have the bug where
temperature was recorded in an unsigned variable.
