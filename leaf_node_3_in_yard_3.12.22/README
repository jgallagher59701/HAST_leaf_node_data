This node was deployed on 28 April 2021 and ran util 7 Jan 2022.

It was in the back yard, buried with the sensor abotu1 inch under the
soil. It sent data to a LoRa receiver in the house (with varying
running status since it was built on a breadboard).

After I opened the node's enclosure, I measured the battery voltage at
3.1 v. There's a picture.

The inside of the enclosure was dry but did have three spots. The
board, electronics and batteries appear untouched. There is no sign of
water damage (or any damage).

The last entry in the SD cards CSV file is a timestamp of Monday,
April 19, 2038 7:34:14 AM GMT-06:00 DST. The main node was
configured to send the current time as it's reply to the leaf node.
The leaf node then updated its RTC to the received time, so it's
possible that a bad packet from the Main node causes the leaf node to
set its time to a bogus value. That would explain the silence once the
time was set to 2038 (the leaf node's software sleeps for 300 seconds
past the current time).

The leaf node was configured to sample once every 5 mins (301 secs)
and made 72,468 samples before stopping - equivalent to a little more
than 8 years of operation at one sample per hour.
