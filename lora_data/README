These files hold CSV data reads from leaf nodes in the backyard
and read from those nodes lora transmissions by a main node running
in the house.

From the notebook:

5/12/21 I repositioned the SHT-30D sensor so it was horizontal and
~1 inch below the surface of the soil. Previously it was vertical
and ~3-4 inches below the surface.

6/24/21 I repositioned the #2 and #3 Meter sensors so they are
horizontal and ~1 inch below the surface. The Meter #2 sensor is
next to leaf node 3's sensor. Meter #3 sensor is in the same general
location.
