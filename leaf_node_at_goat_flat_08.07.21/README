We buried a leaf node with one SHT-30D at Goat Flat on 8/7/21. The
node is set to sample every hour and is still sending the data via
lora although there is nothing there to receive the signal. Instead of
shutting the lora off, I left the leaf node code unchanged from the
version I'm testing in the back yard at 186 Kodiak Trail.

Pictures, maps and waypoint.kml are here. Also, the GPS and Picture data are
online in my jhrg@mac.com GAIA GPS account.
